// Quiet inline PR review comments (#inline-comments) — the CodeRabbit-style line-level layer ON TOP OF the

// `event: COMMENT`, never REQUEST_CHANGES/APPROVE), so a contributor sees exactly what to fix on a resubmission
// without the gate or its verdict ever changing. Default OFF at BOTH layers: the operator flag
// GITTENSORY_REVIEW_INLINE_COMMENTS (+ the per-repo GITTENSORY_REVIEW_REPOS cutover allowlist) AND the per-repo
// `.gittensory.yml` review.inline_comments toggle — the caller ANDs all three to decide whether to ASK the model
// for inline findings AND passes the same resolved gate to the write boundary. Fully FAIL-SAFE: a finding whose
// line is not a commentable line in the PR diff is dropped (GitHub 422s otherwise), and any API error degrades to
// "no inline comments" — it NEVER throws and NEVER touches the gate.

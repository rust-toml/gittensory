// Per-repo signal-snapshot generation (#4013 step 2 -- extracted from processors.ts, second step of the
// file's own module-split sequence, after transient-locks.ts). Pure orchestration over already-exported
// src/signals and src/db primitives. loadOpenQueueCounts moved here too (rather than staying in
// processors.ts and being imported back) since its only two callers are generateSignalSnapshots here and
// processors.ts's own buildBurdenForecasts -- keeping it in processors.ts would have made the two files
// import from each other; processors.ts imports it back from here instead, one direction only.

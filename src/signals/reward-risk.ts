// Reward/risk reasoning signals, extracted to `@jsonbored/gittensory-engine` (#2281) so the gittensory-miner
// can rank candidate work locally with the same logic the maintainer-side gate computes. The implementation
// lives at `packages/gittensory-engine/src/reward-risk.ts`, imported via its RELATIVE SOURCE PATH (matching
// the merged #2276/#2278/#2282 shims) — not the published `@jsonbored/gittensory-engine` specifier, so no
// tsconfig path / vitest alias / root dependency is introduced.
//
// This is a WRAPPING shim rather than the usual pure `export *` re-export. reward-risk depends on the
// maintainer signal stack in `src/signals/engine.ts` (`buildRoleContext`, `buildLaneAdvice`,
// `buildCollisionReport`, `buildQueueHealth`, `buildRepoFitRecommendation`, `buildContributorIntakeHealth`,
// `buildPullRequestReviewIntelligence`) plus `isFailingCheckSummary` from `./local-branch` — none of which
// are extracted yet (and are far too large to port under the size cap). The engine module takes them as an
// injected `RewardRiskEngineDeps`; this shim binds the real `src` builders and threads them in, so every
// existing importer keeps calling the four builders with their original signatures. Once those builders gain
// engine homes, a follow-up can drop the injection and collapse this back to a plain re-export.

# Review-enrichment service (REES)

A standalone Railway microservice that produces a structured **review brief** for the gittensory review engine.

The engine reviews PRs by running a headless `claude --print` subprocess with `Bash`/`WebFetch` disallowed and **no
repo checkout**, so it cannot run a linter, hit a CVE database, resolve a dependency tree, or query git history. REES
fills exactly that gap: given a PR it runs heavy/external/historical analysis and returns a pre-rendered, public-safe
brief the engine splices into the prompt next to grounding + RAG. It is strictly **additive and fail-safe** — the engine
treats any timeout/error as "no brief" and proceeds.

## API

| Route             | Purpose                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /health`     | Liveness (Railway healthcheck).                                                 |
| `GET /ready`      | Readiness.                                                                      |
| `POST /v1/enrich` | `Authorization: Bearer <REES_SHARED_SECRET>` → `EnrichRequest` → `ReviewBrief`. |

See `src/types.ts` for the `EnrichRequest` / `ReviewBrief` contract. When the engine is configured with
`REES_FORWARD_GITHUB_TOKEN=true`, requests can include a GitHub read token so token-aware analyzers can read
CODEOWNERS and blob sizes. Token forwarding is off by default and should be enabled only when the REES endpoint is
inside the operator's trust boundary. The engine prefers a short-lived installation token and falls back to
`GITHUB_PUBLIC_TOKEN`. The service must never log request bodies, diffs, or tokens.

## Analyzers

| Analyzer        | Purpose                                                                      | Network/token behavior                                       |

| `nativeBuild`   | Newly-added dependencies that compile native code or ship sdist-only builds. | Calls npm/PyPI registries.                                  |
| `history`       | Author track record, same-file PR history, and linked-issue alignment.       | Calls GitHub API with bounded fanout; needs author/token for private repos. |

The engine can send `analyzers: ["secret", "actionPin"]` to run a subset. If the field is omitted, REES runs the
full registry. An explicit empty array runs no analyzers; the engine uses that fail-closed shape when an
operator-configured analyzer list contains no valid names.

The engine also sends `budget.timeoutMs` with one second of headroom below `REES_TIMEOUT_MS`, so REES can return a
partial/degraded brief before the caller aborts the HTTP request. If Railway is still running an older REES build,
temporarily raise the engine-side `REES_TIMEOUT_MS` above the REES analyzer budget, or set `REES_ANALYZERS` to a
bounded list that excludes `history` until the budget-aware build is deployed.

## Run locally

```sh
npm install
REES_SHARED_SECRET=dev npm run build && npm start   # listens on :8080
curl localhost:8080/health
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/v1/enrich -H 'authorization: Bearer dev' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"repoFullName":"o/r","prNumber":1}'
```

## Deploy (Railway)

Separate service from the engine. Set **Root Directory = `review-enrichment`** so Railway reads this folder's
`railway.json` + `Dockerfile`. Set `REES_SHARED_SECRET` (same value the engine holds) as a service variable — never
commit it. The engine reaches the service over Railway **private networking** (`<service>.railway.internal`); no public
domain is required.

## Sentry releases and source maps

REES supports optional Sentry error reporting and source-map upload for Railway deployments. The Docker image builds
`dist/*.js.map` with embedded `sourcesContent`, then the runtime startup command injects Sentry debug ids, uploads the
exact post-injection `dist/` files, records a deploy, removes source maps from the running filesystem, and starts
`dist/server.js`.

Set these Railway service variables:

| Variable                       | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SENTRY_DSN`                   | Enables REES error capture. Unset means the SDK is a no-op.             |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`            | Allows the runtime uploader to create releases and upload source maps.  |
| `SENTRY_ORG`                   | Sentry organization slug.                                               |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT`               | Sentry project slug.                                                    |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`           | Optional; defaults to Railway's environment name, then `production`.    |
| `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`    | Optional; defaults to `0`, so errors report without tracing.            |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE`               | Optional override. Only set it when that exact REES bundle is uploaded. |
| `SENTRY_URL`                   | Optional Sentry API URL; defaults to `https://sentry.io`.               |
| `SENTRY_REPOSITORY`            | Optional; defaults to `JSONbored/gittensory` for commit association.    |
| `REES_SENTRY_UPLOAD_STRICT`    | Optional. Set `true` to fail startup if source-map upload fails.        |
| `REES_SENTRY_VALIDATE_RELEASE` | Optional. Set `false` only to disable post-upload release validation.   |

By default the release id is `gittensory-rees@<RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA>`, using Railway's Git metadata. The Sentry
GitHub code mapping should be:

| Sentry field     | Value               |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Stack Trace Root | `/app`              |
| Source Code Root | `review-enrichment` |
| Branch           | `main`              |

Do **not** pass `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` as a Docker build arg. Railway deploys this service from Git, and Docker build args
can leak through image metadata. Keeping the upload at runtime means Sentry sees the same `dist/` files that the service
executes, without exposing source maps over HTTP.

After upload, startup validates the exact `gittensory-rees@<RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA>` release through the Sentry API:
the release must exist, be finalized, include the deployed commit, and include the Railway deploy id/environment. If
`REES_SENTRY_UPLOAD_STRICT=true`, a failed upload or failed validation stops the Railway deployment; otherwise it logs a
`rees_sentry_sourcemap_upload_failed` warning so the problem is visible without blocking startup.

Analyzer failures are still fail-open: the `/v1/enrich` response marks the analyzer as `degraded` and returns a partial
brief. When Sentry is enabled, those degradations are captured as `rees_analyzer_degraded` events with tags/context for
`analyzer`, requested analyzer list, `repo`, `pullNumber`, head SHA prefix, `release`, `environment`, timeout budget,
elapsed time, partial/analyzer status, history lookup counts, GitHub endpoint category, request id, and trace id. Use
those fields to spot a broken analyzer without exposing request bodies, diffs, tokens, prompts, comments, or private
config.

If Sentry still shows frames such as `/app/dist/server.js`, check:

1. The event's `release` is `gittensory-rees@<same Railway commit sha>` or your exact `SENTRY_RELEASE` override.
2. The Sentry release has an artifact bundle uploaded for the REES project.
3. Railway has `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, and `SENTRY_PROJECT` set on the REES service.
4. Startup logs include `sentry_release_validation_complete` for the same release id and Railway deployment id.
5. The Sentry code mapping is `/app` → `review-enrichment` on branch `main`.
6. `npm --prefix review-enrichment run validate:sourcemaps` passes locally.

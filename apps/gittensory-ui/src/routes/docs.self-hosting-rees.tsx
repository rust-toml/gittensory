      <h2>Where REES fits</h2>
      <p>
        REES fires inside the AI review path. It is not a separate status check, dashboard report,
        or PR attachment. When it returns a non-empty <code>promptSection</code>, the engine folds
        that brief into the AI reviewer prompt. The final result is seen only through the normal AI
        review summary, blockers, risks, nits, and decision.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="note">
        A 200 response with no findings can produce no rendered brief. That is expected: the review
        proceeds as if REES had no useful extra context for that PR.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Disable cleanly</h2>
      <p>
        Set <code>GITTENSORY_REVIEW_ENRICHMENT=false</code> to turn off REES for the whole instance.
        To keep REES configured but prevent a repo from using it, remove that repo from{" "}
        <code>GITTENSORY_REVIEW_REPOS</code>. Token forwarding stays off unless you explicitly set{" "}
        <code>REES_FORWARD_GITHUB_TOKEN=true</code>.

GITTENSORY_REVIEW_ENRICHMENT=false

# Keep REES on and explicitly allow token-aware analyzers:
REES_FORWARD_GITHUB_TOKEN=true`}
      />

      <h2>Analyzer selection</h2>
      <p>
        Leave <code>REES_ANALYZERS</code> unset, <code>all</code>, or <code>*</code> to run the full
        REES registry. To run a subset, use exact comma-separated analyzer names. Unknown names are
        ignored with a <code>rees_analyzer_config_invalid</code> warning and the remaining valid
        analyzers still run. If every configured name is invalid, the engine sends an empty analyzer
        list so the typo fails closed instead of running the full registry.

        See the <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-rees-analyzers">REES analyzer reference</Link> for each
        analyzer's inputs, network behavior, and finding shape.
      </p>

      <h2>Request boundary</h2>
      <p>
        When enabled, the engine POSTs the repo name, PR number, head SHA, base SHA when GitHub
        supplies it, title, changed file paths, changed file patches, and review diff to{" "}
        <code>REES_URL</code>. It forwards no GitHub token by default. If{" "}
        <code>REES_FORWARD_GITHUB_TOKEN=true</code>, the engine includes a GitHub read token so
        GitHub API analyzers can read private CODEOWNERS and blob sizes. The engine prefers a
        short-lived installation token and falls back to <code>GITHUB_PUBLIC_TOKEN</code>. Enable
        forwarding only when the REES service is inside your trust boundary.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="safety">
        Do not point <code>REES_URL</code> at a service you do not trust with PR diffs. Token
        forwarding is optional, but the diff/files themselves can contain private code.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Service configuration</h2>
      <p>
        The REES service must use the matching <code>REES_SHARED_SECRET</code>. Optional Sentry env
        captures analyzer degradations without logging request bodies, tokens, diffs, or review
        content.

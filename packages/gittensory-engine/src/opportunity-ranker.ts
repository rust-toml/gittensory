// Opportunity ranker (#2302). The core Phase-1 miner-discovery ranker: it composes five already-normalized,
// deterministic signals into a single ordinal score used to sort a cross-repo candidate-issue list, so a later
// `gittensory_find_opportunities` tool has something deterministic to sort by.
//
// This module is PURE — no IO, no Date, no random — so identical inputs always produce identical order, matching
// the house convention in src/signals/duplicate-winner.ts. Every input is clamped to [0, 1] before use; the sole
// exception is a NON-finite `dupRisk` (NaN/±Infinity), which can't be clamped and fails closed to max risk so a
// broken contention signal never looks safe. Either way a malformed signal degrades the score toward 0 rather than
// inverting or blowing up the product.

 * the whole score to 0: a candidate that fails any one dimension is not an opportunity. Malformed input never passes
 * through raw and always degrades the score toward 0: the four positive factors clamp a non-finite value to 0, and a
 * non-finite `dupRisk` fails closed to 1 (max risk). So a bad signal can neither invert the sign nor overflow the

 * enforced by this function. Mirrors the tie-break intent of `isDuplicateClusterWinnerByClaim` in
